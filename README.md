# datreant web site

The home page [datreant.org](http://datreant.org) is maintained as a [GitHub
pages](https://pages.github.com) site. The home page is also accessible as
[datreant.github.io](http://datreant.github.io)).


## Web development

Check out the repository, edit the pages, and push commits. The
published pages are on the *master* branch.  

We used the [MDAnalysis](http://github.com/mdanalysis) webpage repo
as a starting point. Thanks everyone!

Right now we are using the minimalist [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
theme for [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/),
modified a bit so we don't use it as a blog (no posts).
The `_site` directory is generated by Jekyll on the GitHub server side and
should not be included in commits.

If static pages have the layout type "page" they will be automatically included
in the sidebar.


### Mark-up format: Markdown

The GitHub pages can either use HTML or
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) as processed
by
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).


### Notes on using Jekyll

For links between pages to work, generate absolute links with
`site.baseurl` liquid tag:

```
[see citations]({{site.baseurl}}pages/citations
```

The example will link to the file `/pages/citations`. Also note that
one does not need spaces between the configuration variable and the
curly braces (i.e. `{{ site.baseurl }}` as typical seen), so I avoid
them to prevent the editor breaking the line inside the curly braces
(which upsets Jekyll greatly).

We define additional variables in `_config.yml` and use them with
liquid tags. In particular, the sidebar `_includes/sidebar.html` is
configured with additional links that are all stored in the config file.


### Local testing

To locally test that your edits look ok before pushing them, install
[Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) as
described in the docs.

To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run
`Jekyll` with `Bundler`. Use the command 

    bundle exec jekyll serve 

in the root of your repository (after switching to the gh-pages branch
for project repositories), and your site should be available at
<http://localhost:4000>. For a full list of Jekyll commands, see the
Jekyll documentation.
